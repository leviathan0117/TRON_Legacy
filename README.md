# TRON (v0.0.6-functionality update)
A simple Python 3D graphics library based on OpenGL. Created to allow easier development of small Python 3D programs.

## What's new (from previous version):
* Changeable distance to look point in camera revolve mode
* Windows OS official support started 
* Mouse scrolling now supported
* New mode of movement (CONST_MoveAround)
* New mode of viewing (CONST_CameraLookAround) 
* Code style improvements (PEP8 will never be reached =) )

## Warning
Until version 0.1.0 - code structure, names and function implementations may change chaotically. Verion in README.md may not be updated.

Until version 1.0.0 - code won't be fully tested, so a huge variety of bugs may be present!

## Setup
#####If you have OpenGL installed:

To setup a TRON project - just download the TRON.py file and import it (import TRON).

#####If you DON'T have OpenGL installed:

To install OpenGL in Python simply run in terminal (you may want to activate your virtual environment):

$ pip3 install PyOpenGL

## Examples
There WILL be examples. They are planned to be introduced in version 0.0.10 in a separate folder.

## Why this name?
Noone knows;)
