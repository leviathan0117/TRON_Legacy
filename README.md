# TRON (v0.0.3)
A simple Python 3D graphics library based on OpenGL. Created to allow easier development of small Python 3D programs.

## What's new (from previous version):
* Camera sensitivity
* Color changing (through variables or with function) 
* Line-drawing function

* Movement speed and lockable speed change

## Warning
Until version 0.1.0 - code structure, names and function implementations may change chaotically. Verion in README.md may not be updated.

Until version 1.0.0 - previous versions may (will) not be supported and a huge variety of bugs may be present!

## Setup
If you have OpenGL installed:

To setup a TRON project - just download the TRON.py file and import it (import TRON).

To install OpenGL in Python simply run in terminal (you may want to activate your virtual environment):

pip3 install PyOpenGL

## Examples
There WILL be examples. They are planned to be introduced in version 0.0.10 in a separate folder.

## Why this name?
Noone knows;)
